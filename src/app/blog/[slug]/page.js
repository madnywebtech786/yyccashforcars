        question: "Is it legal to sell a used car privately in Canada?",
        answer:
          "Yes. Private vehicle sales are legal in Canada. You need a bill of sale and to transfer the vehicle registration. Requirements vary by province, and Alberta does not require a safety inspection from the seller.",
      },
      {
        question: "How long does it take to sell a used car in Alberta?",
        answer:
          "Private sales average 3-6 weeks in Calgary. Cash buyers can complete a sale in 1-2 days. Dealership trade-ins happen the same day when buying another vehicle.",
      },
      {
        question: "Do I pay taxes when selling my car privately in Canada?",
        answer:
          "No. Private vehicle sales between individuals are GST/HST exempt. In Alberta, buyers also do not pay sales tax when registering a privately purchased vehicle.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can cash for cars companies buy non-running vehicles?",
        answer:
          "Yes. Cash for cars companies buy vehicles that do not run, including cars with blown engines, transmission failure, or major accident damage. They usually provide free towing.",
      },
      {
        question: "How do I transfer car ownership in Alberta?",
        answer:
          "Sign the transfer section on the vehicle registration, give it to the buyer along with a bill of sale, and remove your plates. The buyer then registers the vehicle at a registry agent.",
      },
      {
        question: "Is it better to sell my car privately or to a dealer?",
        answer:
          "Private sales can bring the highest price but take time. Dealership trade-ins are convenient but usually pay 20-30% less. Cash buyers are ideal for speed or damaged vehicles.",

        question: "Where is the best place to sell a used car in Calgary?",

      },
      {
        question: "Who buys junk cars in Calgary?",
        answer:
          "Cash for cars companies and scrap yards both buy junk vehicles. Cash buyers typically pay more because they resell usable parts or export vehicles.",
      },

        question: "Can I sell a car without a safety inspection in Alberta?",

          "Yes. Alberta does not require sellers to provide a safety inspection certificate. Vehicles can be sold as-is.",
      },
      {
        question: "How fast can I sell my car in Calgary?",
        answer:
          "Cash buyers typically complete sales in 24-48 hours. Private sales take about 3-6 weeks. Dealership trade-ins happen the same day when buying another vehicle.",
      },
      {
        question: "Do I need to clean my car before selling?",
        answer:
          "For private sales, presentation matters. For cash buyers, no. They purchase vehicles in any condition, including dirty or damaged.",
      },
      {
        question: "What if I still owe money on my car?",
        answer:
          "You must pay off the loan before selling. Contact your lender for the payoff amount. Some buyers can pay the lender directly and give you the difference.",
      },

      {
        question: "How much does mileage really affect used car valuation in Alberta?",
        answer:
          "Mileage matters, but total condition matters more. A higher-mileage vehicle with strong maintenance records can be worth more than a lower-mileage car with deferred maintenance.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can I sell my car with mechanical problems in Alberta?",
        answer:
          "Yes. Mechanical issues do not eliminate value. Cash for cars services buy vehicles in any condition because they evaluate parts and salvage value.",
      },
      {
        question: "How does hail damage affect my car value in Calgary?",
        answer:
          "Hail damage can reduce private sale value by 25-40% depending on severity. Cash buyers factor repair costs into offers without extreme discounts.",
      },
      {
        question: "Should I fix my car before selling it in Alberta?",
        answer:
          "Usually no. Repairs rarely return full value in the sale price. Minor cosmetic fixes can help, but major mechanical repairs often do not pay back.",
      },
      {
        question: "Is selling to YYC Cash for Cars safe and legitimate?",
